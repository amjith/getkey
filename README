What is getkey?
-------------------------------------------------------
'getkey' is a utility that can display the key that is currently being pressed in the keyboard.

-------------------------------------------------------
How to compile?
-------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:
-------------
The display is done using xosd, an osd display library.
The record extension in X11 library (xtst) is used for key capture.

How to get xosd and xtst:

Mandriva (64 bit):
> urpmi lib64xosd2-devel lib64xosd2 lib64xtst-devel

Mandriva (32 bit):
> urpmi libxosd2-devel libxosd2 libxtst-devel

Ubuntu:
> apt-get install libxosd-devel libxtst-devel

Compilation:
------------
Run './configure && make'. It should create an executable called 'getkey'.
You can install it system wide by running 'make install'.

Getting Help
------------
Launch it from the command line with the -h option to get help.
> ./getkey -h
Usage: getkey [option]
Options:
  -l  <NUM>
	  Number of keys to display. 
      Set this to -1 for unlimited length. Default: 3
  -t  <NUM>
	  Number of seconds to display the OSD.
      Set this number to 0 to stick the OSD always. Default: 0
  -d  Enable delimiters. Delimiters are special keys that will clear the current keylist history from display.
      Default: Enter, Esc, Space

	  (Don't use this unless you are absolutely sure about the key code)
  -v  show version. 
  -h  Display this help. 


Running
-------
Launch getkey from command line with default options.
> ./getkey

The first key you press will be used as your quit key (I prefer Esc).

After that any key you press will be displayed on the top of the screen in the center. You can press your
choice of quit key to exit the 'getkey' program.
