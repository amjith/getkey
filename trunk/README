Library Req:

You need xosd library and devel packages.
> urpmi lib64xosd2-devel lib64xosd2

Compilation:

Run 'make'. It should create an executable called 'getkey'.

Instructions for running:

Launch getkey
> ./getkey

The first key you press will be used as your quit key (I prefer Esc).

After that any key you press will be displayed on the top of the screen in the center.
