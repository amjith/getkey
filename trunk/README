Mandriva (64 bit):

Ubuntu:

> apt-get install libxosd-devel libxtst-devel

Compilation:

Run 'make'. It should create an executable called 'getkey'.

Instructions for running:

Launch getkey
> ./getkey

The first key you press will be used as your quit key (I prefer Esc).

After that any key you press will be displayed on the top of the screen in the center. You can press your
choice of quit key to exit the 'getkey' program.
