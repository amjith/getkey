Library Req:

xosd library and devel packages.
xtst devel packages. This is an extension package for X11 that has recording routines.

How to compile:

Compilation:

Run 'make'. It should create an executable called 'getkey'.

Instructions for running:

Launch getkey
> ./getkey

The first key you press will be used as your quit key (I prefer Esc).

Usage: getkey [option]
Options:
  -l  <NUM>
	  Number of keys to display. Default: 3
      Set this to -1 for unlimited length. 
  -t  <NUM>
	  Number of seconds to display the OSD. Default: 0
      Set this number to 0 to stick the OSD always.
  -d  Enable delimiters. Delimiters are special keys that will clear the current keylist history.
      Default: Enter, Esc, Space
  -q  <NUM>
	  Specify the key code for the quit key (Don't use this unless you know the key code for your key)
  -v  show version. 
  -h  Display this help. 




After that any key you press will be displayed on the top of the screen in the center. You can press your
choice of quit key to exit the 'getkey' program.
