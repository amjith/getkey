This is a program that displays the key that is currently pressed on your keyboard. This program will run on the background without interfering with your other keyboard activity. So the keys pressed will be sent to the program but at the same time displayed on the screen.

It can be used in screencasts to show keyboard shortcuts on the screen.

This package requires Xosd devel packages and Xtst devel packages.

Requirements:
  * libxosd-devel
  * libxosd2
  * libxtst-dev
